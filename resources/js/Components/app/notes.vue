===== Issues =====
- permanant deletion from trash didn't work
- Download didn't work as like the tut. I replaced str::random() in createzip fun by $filename. Otherwise, it wasn't downloading the zip file as parent name. After replacing , its now working fine.
- I want to upload files, where another file is already exist, but now, it doesn't upload any other file for this existing file. I will do, the all other files will be uploaded except the existing file.
- uploading 1 file, causes uploading 2 files. 
- sometimes folders lost their lft,rgt values, so they are not showing in the tree view. I will fix it later.
- I want to show the file size in the file list, but it is not showing.
