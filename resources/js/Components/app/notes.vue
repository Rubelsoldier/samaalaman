===== Issues =====
- permanant deletion from trash didn't work

Download didn't work as like the tut. I replaced str::random() in createzip fun by $filename. Otherwise, it wasn't downloading the zip file as parent name. After replacing , its now working fine.

I want to upload files, where another file is already exist, but now, it doesn't upload any other file for this existing file. I will do, the all other files will be uploaded except the existing file.

======= To Do ======
1. Selecting multiple files pressing shift .
Keeping code to delete files from public folder after a certain time as, they are files for downloading. No need them later

2. favourites er jono alada page khola like trash page.
